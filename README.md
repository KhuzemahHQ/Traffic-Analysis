# Traffic-Analysis

I ran some analysis on pedestrian and traffic data on King Street in Toronto.

Data was taken from https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/king-st-transit-pilot-detailed-traffic-pedestrian-volumes/

Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence â€“ Toronto.

Baseline traffic & pedestrian volumes were collected during October and early November 2017.
Volumes are classified into cars, single-unit trucks, articulated trucks, bicycles and pedestrians
Volumes are collected at 31 intersections in the Pilot area using a video-based counting system
Approximately one week of activity is captured per month, with more intensive collection conducted in the first months of the pilot
Counts are aggregated by 15 minute time bins
Counts are presented by intersection approach leg (N, S, E, W) and direction of travel (NB, SB, EB, WB)
